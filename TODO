- test time sync workaround in production
- background texture?

- before deploy:
  - choose name for game, website, twitter user (@werewolfgame)
  - revise page copy for directions / instructions with links
  - add cropped illustrations to appropriate pages for production
  - custom 404 and 500 pages

- later:
  - twitter activity feed for #werewolf (or whatever) on main page?
  - should only listen to lynch votes that are @-replied? (encourage publicity?)
  - rss feed for activity (after web interface)
  - add seer player class
  - add multi-werewolf (3+ werewolf) games
  - smarter @-replies: include actual validation errors?
  - home page should auto-redirect to current player game if player is active?
