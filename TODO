- REQUIRE direct message for werewolf kills (don't listen to @-replies at night)
- test time sync workaround in production

- before deploy:
  - proper evented twitter daemon for receiving messages
  - custom 404 and 500 pages

- later:
  - twitter activity feed for #werewolf (or whatever) on main page?
  - should only listen to lynch votes that are @-replied? (encourage publicity?)
  - rss feed for activity (after web interface)
  - add seer player class
  - add multi-werewolf (3+ werewolf) games
  - smarter @-replies: include actual validation errors?
