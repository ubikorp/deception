- display / gather twitter chatter from in-game users (use twitter live search widget?)
- user profile with player notification settings

- auto-start feature (once max players satisfied?)
- add multi-werewolf games (or freeze number to two instead of one as per official rules)
- check time sync issues (needs to be pdq for auto-refresh)

- before deploy:
  - choose name for game, website, twitter user
  - revise page copy for directions / instructions with links
  - add cropped illustrations to appropriate pages for production

- later:
  - should only listen to lynch votes that are @-replied? (encourage publicity?)
  - rss feed for activity (after web interface)
  - add seer player class
  - smarter @-replies: include actual validation errors?
  - home page should auto-redirect to current player game if player is active?
