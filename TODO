- before deploy:

  - custom 404 and 500 pages

- later:
  - twitter activity feed for #werewolf (or whatever) on main page?

  - rss feed for activity (after web interface)
  - add seer player class
  - add multi-werewolf (3+ werewolf) games
  - smarter @-replies: include actual validation errors?
  - home page should auto-redirect to current player game if player is active?
