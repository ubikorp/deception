- add illustrations to appropriate pages
- web interface for player notification settings (user profile)
- display / gather twitter chatter from in-game users (use twitter live search widget?)

- auto-start feature (once max players satisfied?)
- add multi-werewolf games (or freeze number to two instead of one as per official rules)

- check time sync issues (needs to be pdq for auto-refresh)
- revise page copy for directions / instructions with links (use proper gamebot name, etc)

- later:
  - should only listen to lynch votes that are @-replied? (encourage publicity?)
  - rss feed for activity (after web interface)
  - add seer player class
  - smarter @-replies: include actual validation errors?
